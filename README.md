# Fair-Analytics
We use python to analyze county fair STOP reports from the WFA.

Progress Report 12/31/2020:

Class 1 Fairs have been separated into yearly csv files. 

From year to year the content and organization of the STOP reports changes.

Next steps will be distilling the features from all the years into a cohesive representation of a fair.

It is becoming clear that we will need to compute general features accross different years. We need to standardize!

|  COMMON FEATURE  |  YEAR RANGE  |  FEATURE NAME  |
|------------------|-------------------------------|
| STARTING BALANCE |  2001-2003   |  BEGINNING RESOURCES  |
